## Computer Science Project

Your week long project for the computer science module is a chance to explore the analytical nature of computers. It's also a chance to use your web development and design skills to make complex topics more accessible, both for yourself and for others.

Because Computer Science is a very broad topic, the requirements for this project are also somewhat broad, giving you flexibility to focus on areas where you have interest. It's also an opportunity to explore some of the exciting topics that you don't always get a chance to explore at work. Consider teaching yourself about something you don't know much about for this project, such as image processing or natural language processing!

### Requirements

1. Your project must have a focus on a data-structure or an algorithm.
2. Your project should focus on an 'application' rather than an 'implementation' of the algorithm. For example:
	* Using Best First Search algorithms to generate perfect pangrams
	* Using the AC-3 algorithm to solve crossword puzzles
	* Using 'Edge Detection' to create black-and-white line drawings from full color images.
3. Your project must be sufficiently challenging for a week of work.
  * Meaning an instructor must approve your proposal.
4. Your project must be presentable, meaning:
  * You must give a presentation about the work you did
  * Your code must run and produce some result that can be demonstrated
  * __Note That__:
	  * This does not mean you need a web-application (though you can make one as a part of this)
	  * This does not mean you need a web-server (though you can make one as a part of this)
5. The __focus__ of your project should be the algorithm, not the front-end for the algorithm.
	* For example, if you're doing crossword puzzles, it's more important that you can solve one than it is that you have a beautiful interactive display for the solution.

### Ideas and Examples

* Create Visualizations for Cool Algorithms:
	* [graph search](https://golubitsky.github.io/maze_solver/)
	* [Sorting Algorithms](https://visualgo.net/sorting)
* Solve an interesting problem:
	* Solve Crossword Puzzles
	* [Generate Perfect Pangrams](https://github.com/teb311/perfect-pangram-finder)
* Write a game-playing AI Agent
	* Checkers (easier, but still hard)
	* [Chess (harder, but still doable)](http://www.galvanize.com/learn/learn-to-code/chess-ai/#.V88AhpMrLyJ)
* Write a program in assembly language
* Implement image processing algorithms from scratch
	* Gaussian Blur
	* Edge Detection
	* Image Negative
* Create a classification/clustering program
	* Given a dataset representing several things, can you classify those things into groups?
	* Example: Can you tell images of trees from images of humans?
	* Example: Can you tell what genre a movie is based on the synopsis?
* Do something clever with algorithms you already know
	* Can you compute the shortest path distance between any two wikipedia articles?
	* Can you compute the 'Bacon score' of any two actors/actresses using IMDB data?
