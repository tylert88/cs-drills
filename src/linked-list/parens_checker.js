  Testing for matched parenthesis is part of linting as well as part of language design.
  When you run a JS file you are notified if you have mis-matching parenthesis,

  A common way of solving this problem is to use a stack, and you will do so here.
  Complete this function which returns true if a list of characters represents a group
  of properly nested parenthesis/brackets/braces. See the associated test file for
  sample input/output: test/parens_checker.js
